    description:"Tea was introduced in Rwanda in 1952 and is now one of the country’s largest exports. The fertile volcanic soil and temperate climate make for perfect tea growing conditions.The majority of tea is cultivated on large plantations, with a small contribution from tea cooperatives and private growers. Tea plants can be seen covering the rolling hills, their rich green a striking contrast to the blue skies, dirt roads and sunshine.Tea leaves are processed in a dozen tea factories across the country. A number are open to the public, enabling visitors to discover how tea is harvested and processed, with the opportunity to taste the results.Tea plantation tours take place in a variety of locations across Rwanda, with the major ones being around Nyungwe National Park – Gisovu and Gisakura.Tucked away at the far northern edge of Nyungwe National Park, the shimmering fields and winding pathways of the Gisovu Tea Estate sit right up against the primeval Nyungwe forest, where the meticulous rows of tea draw a sharp contrast with the wild forest greenery just behind them.The estate offers both day tours and accommodation, so after a tour of the grounds and cupping ceremony, those with time to spare can unwind here, mountain bike through the grounds, or simply soak up the serenity over never-ending cups of the world’s finest tea.Hugging the undulating hills at the western fringes of Nyungwe Forest National Park, the Gisakura Tea Estate is among the most famous of Rwanda’s tea plantations, and certainly among the most beautiful. Tours and tastings are easily arranged, and while there is currently no accommodation on the plantation itself, there are guesthouses just a short walk or drive away.Keep an eye out for the troop of Colobus monkeys which live in a patch of forest within the plantation.",

    description:"The relatively warm and low-lying plains of Akagera comprise savannah, woodland, wetland and a dozen lakes. In partnership with African Parks, we aim to transform the National Park into a world-class location to experience a safari.The largely open expanse is ideal for game viewing, and we are taking steps to ensure the Big Five roam the park in greater numbers over the course of time.Since 2010 we have cut poaching to an all time low, with the introduction of a helicopter, a canine unit and rhino trackers.A family of lions from South Africa is settling in well, and breeding successfully, and 18 eastern black rhinos have also been reintroduced.Visitors can also encounter buffalo, elephant, antelope, zebra, giraffe, baboons, monkeys, an incredible 490 bird species, plus much more.A boat trip on Lake Ihema is also a highlight of any visit to Akagera, with its large pods of hippos, Nile crocodiles and abundant waterbirds on the island in the middle of the lake.The only way to explore the park is by vehicle, whether through a tour operator or self drive. The National Park also has a vehicle to hire, with individual spaces available on night drives.It is recommended to take up the services of a guide, which can be booked through the park.Sleeping within the park is possible, at various lodges, a bush camp in the north at select periods, or camping in specific sites.",

    rate:"400",
    description:"Nyungwe is one of the oldest rainforests in Africa, and the largest expanse of forest in Rwanda, covering 1,019 km2 of dense Afromontane forests, bamboo-covered slopes, grasslands and wetlands. The park feeds two of the world’s largest rivers, the Congo and the Nile, and provides a significant portion of Rwanda’s freshwater. Over 1,100 recorded plant species, 345 bird species and 85 known mammal species, including 13 of Africa’s primates – notably, chimpanzee, Ruwenzori black-and-white colobus and L’Hoest’s monkeys – are found in this exceptional landscape. Historically, Nyungwe’s rich fauna and flora was exposed to rampant poaching, illegal mining, unsustainable harvesting and agricultural encroachment, endangering the survival of its rich biodiversity. Following a successful partnership with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) in Akagera National Park, in 2020 African Parks was invited by the Rwandan government to sign a 20-year agreement to manage Nyungwe. Together, we are working to restore and protect wildlife, engage with the local communities, and develop a strong tourism offering to improve economic sustainability of the park. Today, the park is building a sense of ownership of conservation among the people who live around it, and developing an ecologically healthy and financially self-sufficient asset",

    description:"Well, you can throw that all out when you visit Kimironko. One of the busiest markets in Rwanda, this is where the city truly comes to life. If you still need to pick up those souvenirs (why not check out a traditional agaseke basket) or just want to get a taste of what an east African market is like, you can’t miss out on this experience.There are four entrances, and while it may seem overwhelming, it gets a little easier to navigate once you get the lay of the land. Everything is organized by category, similar to a department store. Be prepared to negotiate prices and as always use common sense when in a crowded place and stay mindful of your personal belongings. Open seven days a week from 8:00am- 7:00pm, Saturday and Monday mornings are said to be the busiest and Sundays a little slower. And also, get ready to be overwhelmed, but don’t forget to soak in every last detail.",

    description:"“In the heart of Central Africa, so high up that you shiver more than you sweat,” wrote the eminent primatologist Dian Fossey, “are great, old volcanoes towering almost 15,000 feet, and nearly covered with rich, green rainforest – the Virungas.” Situated in the far northwest of Rwanda, Volcanoes National Park protects the steep slopes of this magnificent mountain range – home of the endangered mountain gorilla and a rich mosaic of montane ecosystems, which embrace evergreen and bamboo forest, open grassland, swamp and heath.Volcanoes National Park is named after the chain of dormant volcanoes making up the Virunga Massif: Karisimbi – the highest at 4,507m, Bisoke with its verdant crater lake, Sabinyo, Gahinga and Muhabura. Tracking endangered mountain gorillas through the mysterious intimacy of the rain forest, alive with the calls of 200 species of colorful birds and chattering of the rare golden monkey, is only one of the truly unique experiences in the area.Within the boundaries of Volcanoes National Park are Buhanga Eco-Park, an ancient forest holding Rwanda’s most intriguing folklore and Musanze Caves, formed 62 million years ago after the last estimated volcanic eruption.",

    description:"Peaceful and compact, Huye was founded in the early colonial era, a matter evident in the architecture of the city centre. For a period it was known as Astrida, after the late wife of the Belgian King Leopold III.The region has long been significant as a centre of power, although much of its history has been passed down the generations through oral tradition alone.Today, Huye is a centre of academia, housing the National University of Rwanda and the National Institute of Scientific Research, as well as various training schools and colleges.It is also notably religious, with massive cathedrals and churches where congregations sing with rousing vigour and passion.The excellent Ethnographic Museum, also known as the National Museum, houses perhaps the finest ethnographic collection in Africa. Displays of traditional artefacts and antique monochrome photographs provide an insight in to the pre-colonial era as well as Rwanda’s transition into a modern state.An arboretum, planted with a mixture of exotic and indigenous species, was established on Ruhande Hill in 1933. The 200-hectare forest has recently been dedicated to the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy project, chosen because it is a research forest and a ‘gene bank’ of the forests found in Rwanda, which hold a tremendous importance to the country’s conservation.Nearby, the King’s Palace in Nyanza brings the old ways to life, with its replica royal hut with sacred Inyambo (Ankole) cows in the field behind, to whom their herders sing.",

    description:"A reconstruction of the traditional royal residence, the King’s Palace is a beautifully-crafted thatched dwelling shaped like a beehive.In olden times, Nyanza was the heart of Rwanda. According to oral tradition, it was the site of battles and power struggles.For a long time, the monarchy was mobile, moving the court between various locations. When it eventually settled in one place, Nyanza was the obvious choice. The capital of the kingdom had as many as 2,000 inhabitants, and huts built with the same methods as seen here.At the back live a few long-horned Inyambo cattle, descended from the king’s herd, whose keepers carefully tend and sing to them, keeping alive a unique tradition.The elegant cows, derived from the wider Ankole breed, played an important role during ceremonies in honour of the king. They were decorated with rich jewellery, and were taught to listen to a trainer’s songs and follow his movements in a stately parade.Rwanda ceased to be a monarchy in 1962, when it gained independence from colonial rule. However, the breeding and grooming of Inyambo is still carried out under the Rwanda Agriculture Board.",
